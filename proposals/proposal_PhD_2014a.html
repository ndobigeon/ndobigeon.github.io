        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Over the last several decades, new techniques of imagery have appeared which measure more than the 3 usual Red-Green-Blue wavelengths (see Fig. 1). As soon as the number of wavelengths becomes large (e.g., more than 10 spectral bands), the resulting images are referred to as hyperspectral images. As a consequence, each pixel is associated with a spectrum which may count up to thousands of wavelengths. Such detailed measurements are useful in many areas such as remote sensing (e.g., to recognize and classify cultivated areas) [1] or dermatology (e.g., to diagnose the state of melanomas) [2].</p>

        <p>Much research has been devoted to spectral unmixing, which is an efficient
            way to solve standard problems encountered in hyperspectral imagery. These problems include pixel
            classification, material quantification and subpixel detection. Spectral unmixing aims at decomposing a
            pixel spectrum into a collection of elementary material spectra, usually referred to as endmembers, and at estimating the
            corresponding proportions or abundances [3]. To describe the mixture, the most frequently encountered model is
            the macroscopic model which assumes that the observed pixel spectrum is a weighted linear combination of
            the endmember spectra. Efficient supervised or unsupervised algorithms based on this linear model have
            been proposed in the literature to solve the unmixing problem, which can be considered as a matrix factorization task. In particular, some approaches developed in the Signal &amp; Communication
             group at IRIT Laboratory rely on parametric Bayesian estimation techniques [4].</p>


        <p>
         Most of the works in the literature assume that the number of macroscopic components that are present in the observed scene is a priori known or estimated using
         empirical methods that may be very sensitive with respect to the noise level or other nuisance parameters. Meanwhile, very few attempts have proposed
         relevant and reliable methods to estimate this number (see for instance [5]). In this work, we propose to take advantage of the flexibility and the power of Bayesian nonparametric approaches to include the estimation of the number of materials within a Bayesian unmixing algorithm [6]. This problem of model selection is very challenging since the number of components, their spectral signatures and the proportions of these materials in each image pixel need to be estimated jointly in a fully unsupervised framework. This problem is closely related to a dictionary learning task, which can also be solved using a nonparametric Bayesian framework [7].</p>
