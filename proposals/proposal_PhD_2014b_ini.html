        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Over the last several decades, new techniques of imagery have appeared which measure more than the 3 usual Red-Green-Blue wavelengths (see Fig. 1). As soon as the number of wavelengths becomes large (e.g., more than 10 spectral bands), the resulting images are referred to as hyperspectral images. As a consequence, each pixel is associated with a spectrum which may count up to thousands of wavelengths. Such detailed measurements are useful in many areas such as remote sensing (e.g., to recognize and classify cultivated areas) [1] or dermatology (e.g., to diagnose the state of melanomas) [2]. </p>

        Much research has been devoted to spectral unmixing, which is an efficient
            way to solve standard problems encountered in hyperspectral imagery. These problems include pixel
            classification, material quantification and subpixel detection. Spectral unmixing aims at decomposing a
            pixel spectrum into a collection of elementary material spectra, usually referred to as endmembers, and at estimating the
            corresponding proportions or abundances [3]. To describe the mixture, the most frequently encountered model is
            the macroscopic model which assumes that the observed pixel spectrum is a weighted linear combination of
            the endmember spectra. Efficient supervised or unsupervised algorithms based on this linear model have
            been proposed in the literature to solve the unmixing problem, which can be considered as a matrix factorization task. In particular, some approaches developed in the Signal &amp; Communication group at IRIT Laboratory rely on parametric Bayesian estimation techniques [4].</p>


         <p>Most of the works in the literature assume that a single spectral signature is sufficient to characterize an endmember. Unfortunately this strong assumption  leads to neglect any spectral variability of these components that is present in the acquired images [5]. We propose in this work to implement statistical estimation strategies to account for the variability inherent to the representativeness of a pure material (see for instance [6]). In addition, future missions of Earth observation will acquire multiple multi-band images acquired over the same scene at several time instants, with periods ranging to several years. In this case, it is legitimate to consider that the spectral signature of a component is also changing over time. The second objective of this thesis is to extend standard spectral unmixing techniques for time series images to extract multi-band spectral profiles of macroscopic components that evolve over time.</p>
