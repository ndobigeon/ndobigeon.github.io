        <h1>Joint segmentation of&nbsp;autoregressive processes</h1>

        <p>We propose a joint segmentation algorithm for piecewise constant
        autoregressive (AR) processes recorded by several independent sensors.
        The algorithm is based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. Appropriate
        priors allow to introduce correlations between the change locations of
        the observed signals. Numerical problems inherent to Bayesian inference
        are solved by a Gibbs sampling strategy. The proposed joint
        segmentation methodology yields improved segmentation results when
        compared to parallel and independent individual signal segmentations.
        The initial algorithm is derived for piecewise constant AR processes
        whose orders are fixed on each segment. However, an extension to models
        with unknown model orders is also discussed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The joint segmentation procedure and the main results are detailed in a
            paper published in IEEE Trans. Signal Processing in 2007.

        <h3>Synthetic data</h3>

        <p>
        The accuracy of the proposed abundance estimation procedure is illustrated by segmenting jointly two synthetic time series. The animation (100 frames) available below illustrates the convergence assessment of the algorithm. It represents the successive MMSE estimates of the posterior distributions of the changepoint locations provided by the procedure during the segmentation of the data used in the paper.

        <h3>Real data: detection of "arc-tracking phenomenon"</h3>

        <p>
        We present here the segmentation of real aeronautical data. In order to prevent the aircraft fires provoked by the arc-tracking phenomenon, the algorithm detect the changes that can occur in the signals, modeled here as autoregressive processes. The triphased signals, whose fundamental frequency has been removed (Fig. 1), are jointly segmented. The results (Fig. 2) have been reported in the paper published in IEEE Trans. Signal Processing.<br/>

        <p>
        The results provided by joint and 1D segmentations are illustrated with a speech signal that has been often processed in the literature. These results have been reported in the paper published in IEEE Trans. Signal Processing.<br/>
