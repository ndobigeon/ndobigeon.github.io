        <h1>Comparing nonlinear mixing models for vegetated areas using simulated and real hyperspectral data</h1>
        <h3>Joint work with L. Tits, B. Somers, Y. Altmann and P. Coppin</h3>
        <p>
        Most of the unmixing algorithms proposed in the
        literature rely on the widely acknowledged linear mixing model to
        describe the observed pixels. Unfortunately, this model has been
        shown to be of limited interest for specific scenes, in particular
        when acquired over vegetated areas. Consequently, in the past few
        years, several nonlinear mixing models have been introduced to take
        nonlinear effects into account while performing spectral unmixing. These models have been proposed
        empirically, however without any thorough validation. In this paper,
        the authors take advantage of two sets of real and physical-based
        simulated data to validate the accuracy of various nonlinear models
        in vegetated areas, namely the Fan model, the Nascimento/Somers model, the generalized bilinear model and the polynomial post-nonlinear model (to have a brief overview of these models, the interested reader is invited to consult this <a href="../papers/Dobigeon_IEEE_SP_Mag_2014.pdf">paper</a>). These physics-based models, and
        their corresponding unmixing algorithms, are evaluated with respect
        to their ability of fitting the measured spectra and of providing an
        accurate estimation of the abundance coefficients, considered as the
    spatial distribution of the materials in each pixel.<br/>
