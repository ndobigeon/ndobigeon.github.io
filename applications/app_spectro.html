        <h1>Spectrochemical analysis</h1>

        <p>We address the problem of spectral unmixing when positivity and
            additivity constraints are imposed on the mixing coefficients. A
            hierarchical Bayesian model is introduced to satisfy these two
            constraints. A Gibbs sampler is then proposed to generate samples
            distributed according to the posterior distribution of the unknown
            parameters associated to this Bayesian model. Simulation results
            conducted with synthetic data illustrate the performance of the
            proposed algorithm. The accuracy of this approach is also illustrated
            by unmixing spectra resulting from a multicomponent chemical mixture
            analysis by infrared spectroscopy.

        <h3>Synthetic data</h3>
        <p>
        Simulation results conducted with synthetic data illustrate the performance of the
        proposed algorithm. The spectral sources used in the mixtures are
        simulated to get observed signals similar to real spectrometric data.
        Each spectrum is obtained as a superposition of Gaussian and Lorentzian
        shapes with different and randomly chosen parameters (location,
        amplitude and width). The mixing coefficients are also chosen to get
        evolution profiles similar to kinetic reactions. Figure 1 shows an
        example of M=3 source signals of L=1000 spectral bands. The abundance
        evolution profiles are simulated for N = 15 observation times. An
        i.i.d. Gaussian sequence
        is added to each observation to obtain a signal to noise ratio (SNR)
        equal to 20dB in each mixture.<br/>

        Figure 2 summarizes the
        result of 100 Monte Carlo runs for which the mixing matrix is kept
        unchanged while new sources and noise sequences are generated at each
        simulation. Figure 2-a shows a comparison between the true
        concentrations and their minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimates.
        The proposed Bayesian model has also been implemented with exponential
        priors for the spectral sources . The results obtained with such priors
        are shown in Figure 2-b. It can be firstly noticed that the estimated
        mixing coefficients satisfy positivity and additivity constraints,
        whatever the source prior. Moreover, an improvement in the abundance
        estimation accuracy is noted when using an exponential source prior.<br/>

        <h3>Real data</h3>
        <p>
        To validate the algorithm with real data, an experiment has been performed on mixture data obtained from near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy measurements. Three known chemical species (cyclopentane, cyclohexane and n-pentane) are mixed experimentally with monitored concentrations. These species have been chosen for two main reasons: their available spectra in the NIR frequency bands are highly overlapping. In addition, as these species are inert solvents, they do not interact when they are mixed, which ensures that no new component appears. Figure 3 shows the pure spectra of the chemical species.<br/>

        <p>
        The results of estimation are reported in Fig. 4. It can be noticed that the abundance fraction profiles are estimated correctly, while a small difference between the actual abundances and the estimated ones can be noted. This is explained by the baseline that can be observed in the actual spectra in the spectral domain ranging from 2.4&mu;m to 3.5&mu;m.<br/>
