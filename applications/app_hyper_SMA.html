        <h1>LMM-based unsupervised Bayesian algorithms for spectral mixture analysis</h1>
        <p>
        We propose a Bayesian algorithm that can be used to conduct unsupervised linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA).
        </p>
        <p>Each observed vector (e.g., hyperspectral pixel or measured spectrum) is decomposed as a linear combination of
            pure spectra (e.g., endmembers) following the linear mixing model. This model accounts for standard non-negativity and full-additivity (sum-to-one) constraints
            on the mixing coefficients and non-negativity constraints on the spectral signatures. The central premise of this paper is to propose an algorithm that estimates the spectra and
            their respective proportions jointly in a single step. This approach casts LSMA as a blind source separation (BSS) problem. The proposed joint LSMA approach is able to solve the spectrum estimation problem directly on a lower dimensional space. Indeed, we propose to estimate the projections of the spectra in an appropriate subspace.

            The abundance estimation procedure and the main results are detailed in a paper published in IEEE Trans. Signal Processing in 2009.

        <h3>Application to hyperspectral imagery : synthetic data</h3>

        <p>
        To illustrate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm, simulations are conducted on a 100x100 synthetic
        image. This hyperspectral image is composed of three different regions with R = 3 pure materials
        representative of a suburban scene: construction concrete, green grass and red brick. The spectra of
        these endmembers are represented in Fig. 1 (top, black lines). The reflectances are observed in L = 413 spectral
        bands.<br/>

        <img alt="Actual and estimated spectra" src="../demos/fig_SMA_spectra.png" class="img_app_bis"/><br/>
        Fig. 1. Actual endmembers (black lines), endmembers estimated by N-FINDR (blue lines), endmembers estimated by VCA
        (green lines) and endmembers estimated by proposed approach (red lines).<br/>

        </p>

        <p>
        These R = 3 components have been mixed with proportions that have been randomly generated over the simplex defined by the constraints.
        The generated abundance maps have been depicted in Fig. 2 (top) in gray scale where
        a white (resp. black) pixel stands for the presence (resp. absence) of the material. The signal-to-noise
        ratio has been tuned to SNR = 15dB.<br/>

        The picture above (Fig. 3) was acquired in 1997 over Moffett Field (CA, USA) by the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer <a href="http://aviris.jpl.nasa.gov/">AVIRIS</a> of the JPL laboratory (NASA). <br/>

        The R = 3 endmembers recovered by the proposed joint Bayesian LSMA algorithm
        are depicted in Fig. 4 (top). These endmember spectra are represented in L = 189 spectral bands after
        removing the water absorption bands4. These endmembers are characteristic of the coastal area that
        appears in the image: vegetation, water and soil.<br/>

abundance maps (black (respectively, white) means absence (respectively, presence) of the material).
